## Generative Models for High-granularity Calorimeter of ILD
We are modelling electromagnetic showers in the central region of the Silicon-Tungsten calorimeter of the proposed ILD. We investigate the use of a new architecture: Bounded-Information Bottleneck Autoencoder. In addition, we are utilising WGAN-GP and vanilla GAN approaches. In total, we train 3 generative models.
